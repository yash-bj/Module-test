                            Since we have many new visitors 
                            here this year (welcome!),I’ve rounded 
                            up 29 of the most popular vegetarian main dishes.
                            Keep in mind that all of my recipes are vegetarian,
                            so it wasn’t easy to narrow down the list to a reasonable number.
